        "Each row is one year (1880–present). All temperature values are **anomalies** in degrees Celsius (°C): the deviation from the **1951–1980 global mean** (the baseline). For example, `0.5` means 0.5°C warmer than that baseline; `-0.2` means 0.2°C cooler. In practice, early decades (e.g. 1880s–1970s) often show negative or near-zero anomalies (cooler or similar to the baseline), while recent decades (e.g. 1990s onward) consistently show positive anomalies—recent years often range from about +0.5°C to over +1.2°C, reflecting well-documented global warming. The column **`J-D`** (January–December) is the annual mean land–ocean temperature anomaly and is the main variable we use to correlate with plastic production and other climate indicators. Monthly columns (Jan–Dec) and seasonal columns (e.g. DJF, MAM, JJA, SON) are also present; we focus on `Year` and `J-D` for consistency with the project’s research question.\n",

        "The data are global aggregates from a well-established scientific product, so there is no sample bias in the usual sense. Missing values are encoded as `***`, mainly for (1) the most recent partial year (e.g. 2026) when the year is incomplete, and (2) some derived columns (e.g. D-N, DJF) in early years where the seasonal definition does not apply. We restrict to years with a non-missing `J-D` so that analyses use only complete annual values. Because all time series in the project share a common upward trend over time, we will later need to be careful not to overinterpret correlation as causation. The checkpoint focuses on obtaining and cleaning this dataset.\n"

We did not fill missing values because we need complete annual values for merging.  \n",
